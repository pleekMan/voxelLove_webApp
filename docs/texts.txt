Voxel Love is a playground for vertex shaders.
The vertices are packed inside a cube, within normalized space.
The 3 RGB sliders over the viewport enter the shader as the variable controls.xyz
vertexColor gets passed onto the fragment shader, to modify each vertex color.
Tools used: THREE.js, CodeMirror Editor, Bootstrap.
